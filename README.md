# Scrum Sprint Simulation User Manual

## Introduction

Welcome to the **Scrum Sprint Simulation: Ethical AI Development**! In this interactive game, you’ll take on the role of a Scrum Master leading a virtual team to improve Amazon’s AI recruitment tool over three sprints. Your mission is to deliver maximum value (story points) by building an ethical, unbiased AI system while maintaining quality and team morale, all within a $50,000 budget. You’ll hire a team, select tasks, assign work, tackle ethical challenges, and refine your approach using the PDCA framework.

This manual guides you through each phase, explains mechanics, and provides tips for success. Let’s dive in!

### 5. Sprint Strategy
- **Overview**: Choose strategies inspired by the PDCA framework.
- **Steps**:
  - Options (e.g., "Plan: Bias Audit", "Do: Human Oversight"):
    - **Effect**: Impacts speed, quality, or morale (e.g., "Check: Regular Audits" slows progress but boosts quality).
  - Select up to 2 strategies.
  - Click "Start Sprint".
- **Tips**:
  - "Focus on Quality" reduces bias but slows delivery.
  - "Optional Overtime" increases output but risks morale.

### 6. Sprint

- **Steps**:
  - Watch Kanban board (Backlog → In Progress → Testing → Done).
  - Drag tasks to "In Progress" to start.
  - Respond to events (e.g., "Gender Bias Detected"):
    - Choose options (e.g., "Retrain Model" or "Ignore").
  - Monitor progress, defects (bias/privacy issues), and morale.
  - Proceed to Definition of Done or Retrospective.
- **Tips**:
  - Fix defects in Testing to avoid rework.
  - Balance event responses to maintain morale and ethics.

### 7. Definition of Done (After Sprint 1)
- **Overview**: Set ethical and quality standards.
- **Steps**:

    - **Action Items**: (e.g., "Train staff on SHAP").
  - Answer questions (e.g., "Adjust sprint length?").
  - Click "Continue to Sprint Summary".
- **Tips**:
  - Extend sprints if tasks carry over.
  - Hire specialists for skill gaps.

### 9. Sprint Summary

## Key Mechanics

- **Budget**: $50,000 start. Hiring deducts; firing refunds.
- **Story Points**: Task effort; completed points = value delivered.
- **Task Stages**: Backlog → In Progress → Testing → Done.
- **Defects**: Bias, privacy, or compliance issues; must meet Definition of Done.
- **Team Morale**: Starts at 100%; drops with overtime, boosts with success.
- **Scoring**: Sprint score = points × quality %. Final score adjusts for morale.
